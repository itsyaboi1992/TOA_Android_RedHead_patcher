This script patches the default Tales Of Androgyny Android application with the wonderful Jorja's RedHead Mod.
___
To do this you will need:
* a working GNU/Linux OS (may work on Mac too)
* the default Tales Of Androgyny apk
* Joria's .jar file (possibly of the same version)

And you also need to have installed:
* unzip
* apktool
* apk-signer (link)
* image-magick
___
To use the script:
`git clone` (link)
`cd /path/to/the/script/directory`
`chmod +x TOA_Android_RedHead_patcher.sh`
`./TOA_Android_ReadHead_patcher.sh /path/to/the/file.apk /path/to/the/file.jar`
This will produce a working apk with Joria's mod.
__
If errors appear during the execution regarding zipaligner they can be ignored without problems.

It's necessary to uninstall the default TOA application before installing the patched one as the signature as been modified.

Google Play also will probably give a warning but it can be ignored too.
